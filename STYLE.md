Style Guide
Markdown
Use markdownlint. There's a nice plugin for Atom. Have a look at the default style rules. These rules are selected for readability of source code compatibility with GitHub wiki features.

HTML
Please refrain from using HTML inside markdown files, as a rule. Sometimes, using HTML is the only way to accomplish something, like including an image with a custom width attribute.
